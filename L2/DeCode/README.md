Step 1: In the question bubble, you can find the words spoken by your friend which make no sense at all. <br>

Step 2: While inspecting the page source, you get a clue -> /* Maze runner: Scorch Trials was really scary...Those damned zombies..Yikes */ <br>

Step 3: The keyword over here is "zombie". <br>

Step 4: Search for "Zombie Translator online". <br>

Step 5: Type the text spoken by your friend in the box and the translation of this is the flag! <br> (CTF{You got this})
